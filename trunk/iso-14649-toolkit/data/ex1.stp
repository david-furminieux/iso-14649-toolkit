/* 

The changes here from the original are:
1. The pocket bottom had a fillet of 1.0 radius that was too small for
   the 1.5 edge radius of the endmill. Both radii were removed.
   #18, #30, #35, #36
4. A cutting_edge_length was added to the endmill, since the interpreter
   requires it. #42
5. ELEMENTARY_SURFACE was changed to PLANE in four places. In three of
   these it was used for a feature depth. In the fourth case it was used
   for a security plane. #62, #63, #64, #65
6. The direction of tool turning was changed from counterclockwise to
   clockwise in three places by changing the sign of the speed to minus.
   #40, #45, #48, #50, #52
7. The setup origin was moved to (0,0,0), since the interpreter
   requires it. #95
8. An axis placement that did not have a ref_direction was given one,
   since the interpreter requires it. #81
9. Converted pocket1 from using a general_closed_profile to using a
   rectangular_closed_profile, since interpreter requires it.
   #28, #59, #121, #122, #123, #124
10. Added a fifth NULL attribute to CUTTING_COMPONENT, which requires
   five attributes. #125, #126, #127
11. The endmill radius was too big to fit into the corners of the
   pocket and still leave the required allowance, so it was changed from
   20 to 18 millimeters. #30, #39
12. The values of positive_ratio_measure in DRILLING_TYPE_STRATEGY were
   changed from being in the range 0 to 100 to being in the range 0.0
   to 1.0. #46
13. The values of positive_ratio_measure in two5D_milling_strategy's were
   changed from being in the range 0 to 100 to being in the range 0.0
   to 1.0. #42, #53
14. Changed #60 and #60 from PLUNGE_RAMP to PLUNGE_TOOLAXIS, since only
   PLUNGE_TOOLAXIS is implemented for plane milling.

Note: It is not clear why #29 is called a tapered endmill; it does not
taper.
